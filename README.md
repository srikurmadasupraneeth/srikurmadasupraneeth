### 🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m Praneeth — a passionate developer who doesn’t believe in sticking to just one technology. Whether it’s **Flutter**, **Web**, or **ML**, 
I dive into what excites me and build things that make life better.
My GitHub is proof of my journey: from **mobile apps** to **responsive websites** to **AI integrations**, I learn, apply, and repeat ✨

- 💡 Believer of: *"If you can imagine it, you can build it."*
- 📈 Currently learning: Full Stack Development with **React + Node.js + MySQL/MongoDB**
- 🚀 Future Dream: Build products that matter and land an SDE role at a top product company
- ✌️ Motto: *"No matter what the technology is, I’m ready to learn and act accordingly."*

### 🌟 Why You Should Give Me a Chance

> I'm not just a developer; I’m a **builder**.

I don’t wait for opportunities. I create them. I work at 5AM, break things at 7AM, fix them by 9AM, and build something new by the end of the day.

My projects aren’t clones. They’re **solutions to real problems**.

So if you're looking for someone who brings ideas to life, learns relentlessly, and ships fast with clean code — I’m just one click away.
